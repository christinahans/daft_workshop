# DAFT workshop on NLP at Ironhack, April 2021

In this repo you can find two data files which we will use during the workshop on April 22nd, 2021.

Furthermore, there are a number of packages we will be using during our analysis - if you would like to follow along, please prepare by making sure you have them in your Python environment.

In particular, we will use:

- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- sklearn

There are some useful resources in the nltk library which need to be downloaded before we can use them - after successfully installing nltk, please open a Jupyter notebook or run


`import nltk` \
`nltk.download('punkt')`\
`nltk.download('wordnet')`\
`nltk.download('stopwords')`\


You need to run this only once, and it will be available in all following notebooks.

Looking forward to meeting you all on Thursday!
